1.50 dev 16
* Fixed two critical issues with dev 15. 

1.50 dev 15

* Failed cast detection completely reworked, now based on a characteristic delay in AI() calls while the homun does the cast animation. 
* Added EleanorDoNotSwitchMode option. When this is enabled, all eleanor mode switching must be done manually; we will always assume we are in the right mode. This was requested by Meoryou2. 
* We now log the most recent time that the configuration tool has been used to modify the config file. 
* Added racooons to the default tactics to ignore. 
* Corrected issue with default configuration enabling ChaseSPPause by default
* We detect when someone has modified the AI to use the ranged pierce exploit and write a warning to AAIStartM.txt (assuming the modification was done in the obvious manner). AzzyAI does not condone the use of this exploit, and it may be prohibited on the RO that you play.
* Global variables moved to Const_.lua, this will make the code easier for me to manage. 
* When StickyStandby and DefendStandby are both enabled, homun will not attack targets aggressively if the owner attacks a monster with a lower priority. 
* Corrected issue where an Eleanor might use combo attacks when skill_class tactic was set to minions (ie, sera's summon swarm). 
* Added new grapple tactics. 
* Corrected skill data to include Tinderbreaker cast time. 
* DanceMinSP will not be checked when dancing due to being in berserk mode. 
* Corrected issue with UseEiraOveredBoost
* Corrected spelling of Eira related options
* Corrected issue where low level vani with less than 30 max SP would not autocast caprice. It will now cast the highest level of caprice it can with it's current max SP. 
* When we fail at moving into range to use Painkiller, or cast lavaslide or poison mist under the owner, we now take more aggressive actions. 

GUI:
* ASAP option removed for auto-mist and auto-lava slide. There are issues that could occur when this option was used which could result in a hung situation. 
* Added support for EleanorDoNotSwitchMode options
* Now records the date that start file was saved on to assist in debugging.
* StickyStandby = 2 now supported, this will save standby status through teleport/mapchange/relog. 
* Added support for new grapple tactics
* Corrected spelling of Eira related options

1.50 dev 14
* Added PainkillerFriends option, if set to 1, will try to keep painkiller up on all friended players. Additionally, if a player is manually targeted with painkiller, they will be added to the list of players to Painkiller. If PainkillerFriendsSave option is 1, these lists will be recorded, otherwise, they will only last until the next resummon. 
* Corrected incorrect SKILLCLASS tactic in default H_Tactics.lua
* Success of casting targeted buff skills was not being checked. This has been fixed. 
* Corrected issue where failure to use some skills would result in the AI crashing
* Corrected issue where failed skill use was not treated appropriately.
* Corrected issue with default mercenary configuration in M_Config.lua 
* Added OnAIEnd() callback to enable support for twRO-mod without losing stack space.

* Improved handling of missing data folder; this will now log errors instead of crashing, and will also log to AAIStart. 
* If you have two accounts logged in at once on the same computer from the same RO installation, AND they are friended with eachother, they will autofriend eachothers homunculi and mercenaries. 
* See errata for additional notes on new features

GUI:
* Added IdleWalkSP option
* Fixed issue with GUI crash when working with tactics
* Fixed issue where "once, level:" option could be set for mercenaries; mercenary skills are not level-selectable. 
* Clarified description of LavaSlideMode and PoisonMistMode, corrected copy/paste error.
* Options relating to Painkiller now shown under autobuff options.

1.50 dev 11
* Added support for Pengineer mercenaries
* Improved mercenary identification. 
* Resolved issue with counting monsters for AoEMaximizeTargets that also spammed the error log.

1.50 dev 10
* Corrected issue with default SeraCallLegionLevel, RestXOff and RestYOff values
* Trapped and handled obstacle handling issue in following state. 
* Trapped and corrected several obstacle handling issues, including the one encountered at the enterance to anthell.

* Fixed issue with enabling PVPmode. 
* Fixed issue with spurrious error messages when using a Sera homunculus.

1.50 dev 8:
* Updated AI to be compatible with clients running LUA 5.1 (such as fRO)

1.50 dev 7:
* Urgent Escape is now a defensive buff, not an offensive one
* Added support for using Mental Charge as an offensive buff for Lif type homunculi (not that you'd probably want to use it). 
* Updated documentation to reflect recent changes. 
* Updated documentation regarding installation procedure. 
* Replaced corrupted H_Config.lua and M_Config.lua with working version.

* Corrected issue where homun could end up in endless loop after unsuccessfully attempting to provoke or painkiller owner
* Corrected issue where the AI would crash sometimes when attempting to use painkiller on owner. 

GUI:
* Corrected issue with a crash while creating new tactics. 
* Corrected issue where AttackTimeLimit and AggroHP were confused, resulting in bogus settings being saved and causing the homun to abandon targets inappropriately.


1.50 dev 5:
* Fixed issue with missing PVP tactics files.
* Fixed error encountered with Sera homunculus S. 
* Added "as soon as possible" option to all buffs. Set the option to 3 to enable.
* Renamed UseAutoQuicken to UseOffensiveBuff.
* Renamed UseAutoGuard to UseDefensiveBuff.

* Added support for independent homun and merc PVP tactics. 
* Corrected issue where extras files were not properly saved. 
* Corrected issue where PVP tactics were not saved.




1.50 dev 4:
* Added support for CLASS_MINION skill class tactic - if this is set as skill tactic, Sera will use Call Legion on this class of monster
* UseSmartAOE now supports all skills (except brandish is still done approximately)
* Clever chase now prevents normal following too
* Other changes and fixes - changelog file got reverted at some point.
* Added basic PVP support 

1.50 dev 3
* Fixed issue with TACT_IGNORE and TACT_TANKMOB not working as advertised or intended. 
* Fixed multiple issues with CleverChase
* Added CHASE_CLEVER tactic; This is probably the correct way to use CleverChase. Monsters with the chase tactic set to CHASE_CLEVER will use CleverChase even if CleverChase is otherwise turned off. They will still observe CleverChaseSP and CleverChaseTime
* Fixed issue with Sera skill, Painkiller being spammed when it shouldn't. 
* Added tracking for the status of Sera's Legion (the rest of this functionality isn't done yet)
* Added ProvokeOwnerMobbed option - If owner is below 90% hp, and has at least this many monsters on him, THEN use provoke (ie, painkiller) on them. This way you can use it on a fragile genetic without wasting time casting it when he's safe and healthy.

* Added a few options for stonewalling as a bayeri (Stien Wand, that is. "Stien wand" is german for "stone wall")

BayeriSteinWandLevel - Use this level of steinwand - useful if you want to use shorter lasting one (at the expense of a flimsy wall)
UseStienWandTele - Use stienwand when you log in and when you land from teleport, but never any other time. I'd suggest using this with DoNotUseChase. 
StienWandTelePause - stand still for this long after casting stienwand

The idea is that you would land, pop stienwand, and then pause for a second or few while the monsters run to you, and then the bay can drop a Heilage Star (Holy Rod) on the monsters that run to you. 

UseBayeriSteinWand	- Use Stienwand when bay or owner is mobbed. Works like other kinds of buffs. 
UseSteinWandOwnerMob	- This many monsters on owner will trigger steinwand use. 0 = don't use stienwand in response to mobs on owner
UseSteinWandSelfMob	- This many monsters on the bay will trigger steinwand use. 0 = don't use stienwand in response to mobs on bay


Using both of these (UseSteinWandTele and using it while mobbed) is probably not a good idea. The two are not aware of eachother. 

1.50 dev 2
* Slimmed down documentation file size. 
* Fixed error when using all mercenaries. 
* Fixed error when using mercenaries with level 2 or higher of the skill Crash.
* Fixed issue with ReserveAoESP not working at all
* Fixed issue with ReserveAoESP not working for chase skills
* Fixed issue with ReserveAoESP not working for AoE-as-buff mode.
* Fixed issue with AOE-as-buff mode not working at all.
* Missing fix for Dieter skills (from 1.40 dev 20) replaced. 
* Fixed issue with AOE-as-buff mode failing to account for skills having a finite range.
* Fixed AutoMobMode=2 to correctly count only aggro monsters.
* We no longer count dead or dying monsters when deciding whether to use an AoE. This should correct the long-standing behavior where a homun deals the dying blow to 1 monster as another monster arrives, and then (with AutoMobCount=2) uses it's AoE attack on them. 
* Provoke only worked with mode 1 (during idle state). Now it works all the time. 

1.50 dev 1 - Initial 1.50 release, see ToDo list for more changes.  
* Added SP, Weight, Chase, and Snipe tactics.
* Added support for use of castling. 
* Replaced old system for idle walking motions
* Added option to use AoE skills like buffs on the owner.
* Added SP and skill failure watcher
* Added clever chase
* Implemented use of combo skills
* Added new basic tactics
* Added low priority heal option
* Added option for buffing at times other than in idle state.
* Improved support for multiple homuns
* Added option for aggressive tracking of relogs
* Treasure Boxes are now ignored by default as a fail-safe.
* Snipe will not be used if it should be using an AoE skill
* Added opportunistic target changes
* Added DanceMinSP option
* Various other changes and additions

1.41
* Fixed critical issue with mercenary AoE skills introduced by 1.40 dev 19 
* Fixed issue with UseSmartAOE when used with FAS which can cause the mercenary to incorrectly select targets with FAS when handling targets to the northwest or southeast of the mercenary. 
* The area of Brandish Spear is calculated incorrectly for comparison to UseAutoMobCount. This will be fixed in 1.50 as the framework planned for this is not ready. 
* Corrected improper use of FAS when there were not enough monsters on screen.
* Corrected issue with FAS target counting of monsters in the four cardinal directions being 2 cells narrower in the vertical direction (this meant that the area it was counting for east/west direction was only 1 cell wide).
* Corrected issue with FAS target counting of monsters in the diagonal directions always counting zero monsters. 
* Corrected issue with mercenaries failing to correctly use debuff skills
* Corrected AutoMobCount to 2 in default mercenary settings. 

1.40 Final
* Padded skill delays to reduce the liklihood of the AI trying to recast skills before the cooldown is up due to lag, flywings, etc. This is 5 seconds for bloodlust, 1-1.5 for flitting/accel flight - so you can still make it bug by winging around alot - or of course if you log out or manually cast the skill - but this should help significantly
* Padded lava slide and a few other skills with a short delay, because my tests indicate that they seem to have one, and we were trying to cast other skills during that delay and failing. 
* AI will not let you cast SBR 44 manually, unless you set AllowSBR44=1 in H_Extra. Misclick insurance. Unfortunately, I can't do the same for self destruct

1.40 dev 23 - release candidate
* Fixed MobSkillFixedLevel option
* RESCUE_ALL will now rescue if the target is friend or owner, but not if target is self. This makes a lot more sense. 
* Fixed issue with failing to use autobuffs on homunculi with more than one buff with a non-zero cast time and delay, due to failure to check delay status. 
* Corrected default H_Tactics to use basic tactic ATTACK_M instead of REACT_M, an error introduced by poor source control in dev 21 and 22. 
* Improved logging around autobuff and healing skills.
* Added function to improve human readability of skill-usage logging in future updates.

1.40 dev 22 - release candidate
* Fixed issue with Chaotic Blessings and Healing Hands not correctly using cooldown. 
* Fixed issue in which UseAutoSkill_MinSP would be ignored if Berserk_IgnoreMinSP (defaults to 1) was enabled, even when the AI wasn't in berserk mode.
* Cleaned up SP checking, much easier to read and work on now
* Cleaned up attack state logging. 
* New option for homuns: MobSkillFixedLevel - if set to 1, always use the level set via (homuntype)(skill)Level option (ex, DieterLavaSlideLevel)) for antimob skills, ignoring tactics stating otherwise. Defaults to 1. I've been seeing lots of people using lvl 1~4 of lava slide in OD2, and i'm pretty sure it's because they wanted to use lvl 1~4 of the bolt skills, but level 5 of lava slide.  
* Fixed issue with commanding homunculus to use skills not behaving as expected. 
* Fixed issue with UseSkillOnly mode not correctly using attack ranges
* Fixed issue with Sera skill Poison Mist not properly using cooldown
* Fixed major issue with incorrectly estimating casting times. 
* Fixed issue with incorrectly calculating cooldown options
* Added cooldown on Lava Slide ("what? you didn't have one already?" you say? See last point).
* Improved logging around skill cooldowns.  

1.40 dev 21 - release candidate
* Fixed issue with sniping
* Fixed issue with tanking
* Updated documentation

1.40 dev 20 - release candidate
* Fixed issue with Dieter selfbuff skills
* Added OnInit() call, for players to handle multiple homun AI configurations. 
* Added protection for file conflict issue when using multiple homuns at once - will now fail gracefully. 
* AoE skill count no longer counts killsteals as targets when deciding whether to cast an AoE
* Sonic claw delay is back, because the GMs added a short delay on it
* Added UseSmartBulwark option. 

1.40 dev 19 - release candidate
* Sonic claw will be spammed faster now
* Fixed issue with movement destination selection. This will fix issue with choosing non-optimal cells to move to, and prevent a hang possible under unusual conditions. 
* Corrected issue with monster counting function. 
* Corrected anti-mob skills to count the monsters within the AoE instead of the monsters currently near the homun. 
* Fixed timing for Sera's Poison Mist skill
* Internal stability improvements
* Added improved tracing for issue with failure to call AI()
* Improved reporting of serious error conditions. Please delete all AAI*.log files in your RO folder. 
* Improved reporting of time in AAIStartH/AAIStartM files.

1.40 dev 18 - release candidate
* Deactivate dance attack near edges of screen. This will prevent an obstacle-slide effect from pushing homun off screen.

1.40 dev 17
* Corrected bloodlust support
* Improved behavior when chasing moving targets - if you're faster, you'll catch it now. 
* Fixed issue with loop at edges of screen

1.40 dev 16
* Corrected issue with improper default values contributing to improperly dropped targets. 
* Improved system for chasing blocked targets. 
* Improved catches for rescue loops. 
* Possible improvement in dance attack
* Improved logging around chasing and movement. 


1.40 dev 15
* Independent cooldown timers for Moonlight, Caprice, Chaotic Blessing, and Healing Hands. I have not tested this with a homun with more than 1 attack skill since I don't have any yet, so try it out and see if it works. 
* Added improved logging to try to nail down a freeze bug.
* Support Bloodlust Autocast

1.40 dev 14
* Fixed critical issue that lead to homun running off screen.
* Fixed issue where fix for archers introduced with dev 7 was not applied when homun HP was above AggroHP
* Minor responsiveness tweaks. 
* Fixed more improper tail calls.
* Fixed a number of cases where responsiveness measures were being used improperly, forcing me to use more conservative settings for the responsiveness measures. This has been corrected. (this will be tested with more aggressive settings, and these will be included in the next version if they do not adversely effect stability).
* Fixed issue with improperly dropped targets
* Fixed issue with follow state in strongly adverse conditions. 
* Fixed issue with spurious warnings in AAI_Warning.log - changes introduced in dev 9 had led to warnings being produced under normal circumstance.

1.40 dev 13
* Fixed issue with moving long distances. 
* Improved chasing behavior, should fix the wobble.
* Improved boundary detection while chasing. 
* Fixed issue with SP being counted incorrectly when using skill levels other than max level
* Fixed issue a distance function in AzzyUtil.lua (no reported issues in the field). 
* Fixed issue with occasional target dropping while closing to melee range. 
* Fixed numerous serious bugs with skill while chasing. 


1.40 dev 12
* Fixed critical issue with sniping tactic. 

1.40 dev 11
* Fixed issue with provoke state. 
* Fixed issue with provoke skill info.
* Fixed issue with AI mistaking sacrifice for provoke
* Three above issues combined to cause crashes on homuns with sacrifice when autoprovoke was enabled.

1.40 Dev 10
* Fixed issue where we attempted to use math.huge which isn't implemented in lua 5.0.2
* Fixed issue where chase state tried to move to a target one last time after dropping it's old target. 
* Fixed line 667 error, which was caused by the combination of the two above bugs. 
* Corrected error where stationary aggrodist and movebound would be used if the owner was moving only in the north-south direction. 
* Improved logging for the closest cell calculations, because they're brittle and cause a lot of problems. 
* Corrected issue with ranged mercenaries moving 1 cell closer than they need to when approaching targets from the west and south. 

1.40 Dev 9
* Removed posbug correction code - was causing dropped targets, inappropriate dancing, and other issues because it is impossible to detect posbug due to GetV() bug, and hence was activating even when not posbugged. 
* Fixed issue with Sniping - TACT_SNIPE_L/M/H should now work. If you can 1-shot in OD2, try it out! Makes much better use of SP. 
* Fixed issue that could cause a high-speed homunculus to run off the screen chasing a monster. We will now drop the target instead. This was killing people in OD2.
* Fixed improper tail call from chase to idle.
* Default tactics are now a bit better: They default to not attacking the stupid event mobs, nor ants and giearths for doing ant eggs. 
* Set DoNotAttackMoving in H_Extra to make the homunculus not attack stuff that's moving. It'll still continue chasing them if they do move, though. This is not the final version of this feature, but it's been requested by several people - here's an interim solution. 


1.40 Dev 8 
Quick bugfix release
* Fixed follow obstacle fix from previous versions as it was not being used correctly
* Fixed attack posbug fix, which was suffering from an almost identical issue
* Fixed missing geographer tactic.

1.40 Dev 7x
* Fixed the attack chase loop bug.

1.40 Dev 7
* Added support for autoskill skill selection tactic - Manually edit H_Tactics.lua and chance the size tactic to CLASS_BOTH (to use either pre-S or homunS skills), CLASS_OLD (for pre-s skill only), or CLASS_S (for S skills only), or CLASS_MOB (if, for some reason, you want to use a mob skill on this, even if there aren't enough targets around to normally justify using a mob attack (per MobAttackCount) - i expect this to be most useful for mercenaries, particularly the lvl 10 sword merc, where you might want it to use BB for the higher damage - of course tactics for mercs require MobID - so maybe this isn't so useful.) For mercenaries, you can edit this using the GUI - use the TACT_SIZE tactic, SIZE_LARGE is the same as CLASS_MOB, SIZE_UNDEFINED should be used in all other cases (since there's no S-class skills for merc)
* Unified code between chase skill use and attack skill use
* Fixed longstanding issue with debuff while attacking which would prevent the homun from using debuffs while attacking if told via tactics to use a certain debuff skill. This bug has been present since 1.30 or earlier and had not been reported. Did anyone try to use this?
* Corrected boneheaded prioritization of targets which resulted in the homun aggroing new monsters while ignoring monsters currently attacking him. This was a really really nasty bug IMO. 
* FOLLOW_ST with FAST CHANGE did not use proper tail call when changing to IDLE_ST, this was corrected (internal change)
* Removed more obsolete code
* Fixed a few potential error message
* Fixed issue with empty AAI_Warning file
* Fixed error with bow mercenaries that have the skill Double Strafe
* Another change dedicated to truly eradicate the follow state hang.
* Fixed issue with inappropriate use of antiposbug measures which could cause problems around obstacles. 
* Fixed issue where the wrong measure of range was compared to MoveBounds for attacking monsters outside AggroDist, resulting in failure to defend against ranged attackers (like those blasted orc archers!) on the edges of the screen.  
* Improved tracing to try to trace down yet another freeze issue. 

1.40 Dev 6x2, 6x3
* Fixed issues in M_SkillList.lua

1.40 Dev 6x1
* Fixed missing config program and fixed an issue in M_SkillList.lua


1.40 Dev 6
* Corrected issue with AttackRange() leading to homuns not closing to 1 cell range, resulting in Filirs and Eleanors not closing to skill range
* Corrected issue with MotionClasses resulting in monsters currently targeting the owner not being correctly given priority
* Follow state no longer attempts to move to the owner's location; That doesn't work anymore. Follow state will now move to 1 cell range if it can't move to distance specified in FollowStayBack for ~500ms, and after another ~500ms it will use MoveToOwner() builtin. 
* Corrected issue where follow behavior did not return to normal if the homun was interrupted while in follow state. Combined with above, homun could hang in freeze state until vap/recalled. 
* M_SkillList.lua now loads. 
* Accellerated Flight now works. It is classified as a defensive skill (turn on UseAutoGuard to use it). 
* Obsolete code removed from AzzyUtil
* Pierce size removed. This variable and tactic will be removed or repurposed in a future release. 
* Added AoE info to the skill info database - this is not currently used. 
* Added additional AI tracing. 
* Removed unneeded files accidentally included in previous packages

1.40 Dev 5 
* HUGE internal overhaul of skill selection
* Fix for issue with manually commanding homun to use skills
* Fix for random error caused by new aggrodist/movebounds
* Fix for incorrect Stahl Horn range
* Closer to support for new buff skills
* Fix for vibrating homun when sitting issue.
* Support for Homun S buff skills



1.40 Dev 3
* Fixed issue with dance attack
* Fixed issue with chase targeting 
* Fixed issue with sniping activating incorrectly
* Fixed issue that may have been triggering freezes (sending invalid move commands)
* Fixed issue with poor handling of ranged monsters near edge of screen. See the two new AggroDist values in H_Extra
* Added support for Sera autocasting painkiller on you (set UseOwnerProvoke=1 in H_Extra to enable!)
* Added support for vani's healing themselves ( turn on UseAutoHeal and it will kick in automatically. Control the %hp that it will activate at with HealHomunHP in H_Extra)
* Added support for choosing which skills to use while chasing. 

** Known issue: Stahl horn is assumed to have a range of 5 at all levels, instead of 4+SkillLevel. The fix is understood, but a bit tedious (need to update all calls to a function). 


1.40 dev 2

* Fixed issues with chase when UseSkillOnly=0 that really should have been fixed long ago. (special thanks to Notepad ++ for this one!). My appologies to the people who reported this and who I accused of installing the AI wrong. There was a bug there afterall!
* Added framework to autouse Homun S buffs. 
* Fixed commands to use skills on non-monsters. Previously homun would not try to get in range to use the skill. 
* Added some development logging. Please contact me if an AAI_WARNING.log or AAI_RMsg.log is created in your RO folder!

AI: 
* Added basic support for new homuns.
* You must tell the AI which homun you had before if it's not a vani
* Made some improvements to motion locking issue - this is an issue I'm currently not entirely sure of the underlying basis of. I think it has to do with the horrible change to Move() behavior recently. 
* Added support for using Homun S skills automatically. This has known issues, but is probably better than before. 

* Features not anywhere near done.
